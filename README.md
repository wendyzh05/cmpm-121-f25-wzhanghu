This section activity is intended to introduce you to many of the tools and workflows that we'll use in CMPM 121, Game Development Patterns.

Key tools:

- [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces), a cloud-based development environment based [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) that runs in your web browser.
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), a CI/CD service that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline.
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), a static site hosting service that allows you to publish web content for free.

Key workflows:

- Forking a project template repository to create your own copy.
- Configuring your repository to enable deployment automation (GitHub Actions) (deployment automation) and publishing (GitHub Pages).
- Accessing that repository using your IDE (Codespaces or local VS Code).
- Launching a local development server to preview your project in a web browser.
- Making a small change to the project.
- Manually testing your change locally.
- Committing and pushing your change to your remote repository on GitHub, verifying that the deployment succeeds.
- Removing this introductory documentation and replacing it with your own so that your project represents your voice, not that of the course staff. (Students: Don't let _this_ README.md be the only documentation in your project!)
- Repeating the editing-to-publishing process to build familiarity with the overall workflow.
